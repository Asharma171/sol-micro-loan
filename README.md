# sol-micro-loan
SolMicroLoan is a decentralized platform built on the Solana blockchain that connects borrowers and lenders directly to facilitate micro-loans. Leveraging Solana's high throughput and low transaction costs, the platform aims to democratise access to credit by eliminating traditional financial intermediaries. Users can create loan requests with specified terms, and lenders can fund these loans securely and transparently. The platform includes a user-friendly frontend interface, a robust backend server, and smart contracts written in Rust using the Anchor framework.
